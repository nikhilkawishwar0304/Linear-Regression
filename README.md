# Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning-Modules

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm carried out in four steps- 

1. Loading the training data
2. Scaling the fetaures using normalization (feature normalize.m)
3. Compute cost (Errors made with current values of parameters)
4. Iterative Gradient Descent to converge cost to minma
